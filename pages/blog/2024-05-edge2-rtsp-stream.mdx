# RTSP Streaming on the Khadas Edge2

This is a small experiment trying to use the RTSP protocol
to stream camera footage from the Khadas Edge2.

# Prequisites

Considering you are on a debian based platform, you'll need to make sure your device has `gstreamer` 
installed with the necessary rockchip-mpp plugins.

To make the most of the device's streaming capability, try connecting to the device to a **802.11 ac/ax** capable router.
In my simple testing **802.11b/g/n** just wasn't able to keep up with the latency at higher resolutions.

First, install the gstreamer plugins for RTSP sink:
```shell copy
sudo apt install libgstrtspserver-1.0-0 gstreamer1.0-rtsp
```

Then, get the the RTSP server:
```shell copy
wget https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/download/v1.8.2/mediamtx_v1.8.2_linux_arm64v8.tar.gz
tar xvf mediamtx_v1.8.2_linux_arm64v8.tar.gz
```

# Running the RTSP server
Launch an instance of the RTSP server in the background,
```shell copy
./mediamtx & 
```

You should be presented with some info regarding to streaming the port numbers for streaming.
```shell
zephyr@onyx:~$ ./mediamtx &
[1] 1303
zephyr@onyx:~$ 2024/05/28 11:47:53 INF MediaMTX v1.8.2

```

<Callout type="info">
You will need to run the server in the background in each shell session when running the streaming setup.

# Constructing the GStreamer Pipeline

The most basic pipeline you can use to stream video from the device would be to capture the video
from any of the camera devices, in my case I'm using the `IMX415` camera
connected to the `CAM1` port (`/dev/video42`), 
```shell
v4l2src device=/dev/video42 io-mode=dmabuf
```

and encoding the video using the H.264 encoder 
```shell
mpph264enc ! h264parse
```

and handing it off to the RTSP server.
```shell 
rtspclientsink location=rtsp://localhost:8554/test
```

Here the `/test` is just a testing node, you could rename this to something more appropriate like `/camera`,
but for the sake of this example we will just use `/test`

thus giving us:
```shell copy
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video42 io-mode=dmabuf ! \
    mpph264enc ! h264parse ! \
    rtspclientsink location=rtsp://localhost:8554/test
```

You can view the stream by using another computer on the network using `ffplay`

```shell copy
ffplay -i rtsp://< device ip_address >:8554/test
```

However we can build upon this pipeline and make it a bit more optimized for bandwidth, 
First by which, is switching over to HEVC/H.265 encoding, which uses `mpph265enc` in the pipeline.

```shell copy
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video42 io-mode=dmabuf ! \
    mpph265enc ! h265parse ! \
    rtspclientsink location=rtsp://localhost:8554/test
```

We can also resize the video before transmitting, I reduced the resolution to around 720p (1280x720)
and encoded with h.265 to obtain the most optimal balance of video quality with low packet loss/video artifacting.

```shell copy
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video42 io-mode=dmabuf ! \
    video/x-raw,format=NV21,width=1280,height=720 ! \
    mpph265enc ! h265parse ! \
    rtspclientsink location=rtsp://localhost:8554/test
```

# Result

I was able to stream it across a 802.11ac router as well as over a hotspot setup 
where the Edge2 created a wireless network to which I connected my computer to.

Overall this is a pretty good setup to get a seamless video stream from the Edge2 but the latency
isn't doing any favors when I'm interesting in something like FPV streaming over wifi, I will probably
have to look into other methods that are better for that sort of application.
