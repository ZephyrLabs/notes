# Introduction
RKNN2 is Rockchip's software suite to utilize the NPU on their new device platforms like the RK3588 and RK3566.

The NPU doesn't directly run models as is, you need to convert them into the custom `.rknn` format.

To do so, there is the RKNN-Toolkit2 which lets you analyze, quantize, convert and see how the model would run on the NPU layer wise.

# Prequisites

This guide is a look into how you can convert and run some basic TFLite models, it targets the following platforms
* **RK3566** / **RK3568** (1.0 TOPs NPU)
* **RK3588** / **RK3588S** (6.0 TOPs NPU)

The platform should also be running 64 bit Linux firmware.

Your system will need to have the following to **convert** models:
* A x86/64 machine, running Ubuntu 22.04/20.04/18.04
* python3 and pip
* python libraries (`rknn_toolkit2` etc.)

Feel free to install the python packages inside a virtual environment (`venv`), if you don't want to trash the system installed packages.

Your system will need to have the following to **run** models:
* python3 and pip
* python libraries (`rknn_toolkit_lite2`, `numpy`, `cv2`, `pillow`, etc.)
* Have the right rknn libs (`librknnrt.so`)

# Converting models to RKNN
<Steps>
### Install pip
```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

### Clone the examples repository
```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/sravansenthiln1/rknn_tflite
cd rknn_tflite
```

### Get the Rockchip NPU tools
```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rknn-toolkit2
cd rknn-toolkit2
git checkout b25dadacc24b88eb7dfcaa47c9c525ecca89b319
```

### Find the appropriate python version
```shell copy
python3 --version
```

and run the command accordingly

| python version | command |
|---|---|
| 3.11 | `version=cp311` |
| 3.10 | `version=cp310` |
| 3.9 | `version=cp39` |
| 3.8 | `version=cp38` |
| 3.7 | `version=cp37` |
| 3.6 | `version=cp36` |

### Install the requirements and the toolkit 
```shell copy
pip3 install -r rknn-toolkit2/packages/requirements_$version-*.txt
pip3 install rknn-toolkit2/packages/rknn_toolkit2-*-$version-$version-linux_x86_64.whl
cd ../
```

### Downloading the script
On your host workspace, get the script in the directory of your model:
```shell copy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sravansenthiln1/rknn_tflite/main/convert.py
```

### Convert the model
To convert a file such as model.tflite, run
```shell
python3 convert.py model
```

Once converted, you can copy the `model.rknn` file over to your board to run inference

<Callout type="info">
The script doesn't optimize the model weights for RKNN, to maintain the original model characteristics.
</Callout>
</Steps>

<Callout>
You can modify the optimization and target platform variables in the script accordingly, 

```python copy
rknn.config(target_platform='rk3588s', optimization_level=0)
```

the target_platform is your device soc, such as `rk3588`, `rk3566`, `rv1103` etc.
the optimization_level is the RKNN optimization, where `0` is model as is converted, and `2` is the maximum optimization where weights can be quantized.
</Callout>

# Setting up RKNN on target devices
<Steps>
### Install pip
```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

### Install the necessary python packages
```shell
pip3 install numpy pillow opencv-python librosa sounddevice
```

### Get the Rockchip NPU tools
```shell
git clone https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rknn-toolkit2
cd rknn-toolkit2
git checkout b25dadacc24b88eb7dfcaa47c9c525ecca89b319
```

### Find the system python version
```
python3 --version
```
and run the command accordingly
| python version | command |
|---|---|
| 3.11 | `version=cp311` |
| 3.10 | `version=cp310` |
| 3.9 | `version=cp39` |
| 3.8 | `version=cp38` |
| 3.7 | `version=cp37` |
| 3.6 | `version=cp36` |

### Install the appropriate toolkit wheel
```shell
pip3 install rknn_toolkit_lite2/packages/rknn_toolkit_lite2-*-$version-$version-linux_aarch64.whl
```

### Copy the runtime library
```shell
sudo cp rknpu2/runtime/Linux/librknn_api/aarch64/librknnrt.so /usr/lib/
cd ../
```
</Steps>
