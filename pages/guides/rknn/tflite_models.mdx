# Introduction
RKNN2 is Rockchip's software suite to utilize the NPU on their new device platforms like the RK3588 and RK3566.

The NPU doesn't directly run models as is, you need to convert them into the custom `.rknn` format.

To do so, there is the RKNN-Toolkit2 which lets you analyze, quantize, convert and see how the model would run on the NPU layer wise.

# Prequisites

This guide is a look into how you can convert and run some basic TFLite models, it targets the following platforms
* RK3566/RK3568 (1.0 TOPs NPU)
* RK3588/RK3588S (6.0 TOPs NPU)

You can check out https://github.com/sravansenthiln1/rknn_tflite for the example code and other details.

# Running an example model
Here's an example running the sample CNN model that predicts digits from the popular MNIST dataset.

![mnist digit](/guides/armnn/mnist.png)

The sample resides at https://github.com/sravansenthiln1/rknn_tflite/tree/main/digit_recognize

and has the pre-trained and converted model to test.

Here's the run through of the code running the inference

<Steps>
### Importing our essential libraries
```python copy
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import time

from rknnlite.api import RKNNLite
```

### Defining the file paths
we have to define the file paths for things such as the model and input.

Set the path to the model
```python copy
MODEL_PATH = "./digit_recognize_28.rknn"
```

Set the path to the input image
```python copy
IMAGE_PATH = "./digit7.png"
```

### Creating a RKNNlite handle
Create a class instance for interacting with RKNN
```python copy
rknn_lite = RKNNLite()
```

### Load the RKNN model
Load the RKNN model using the previously created RKNNLite instance
```python copy
ret = rknn_lite.load_rknn(MODEL_PATH)
if ret != 0:
    print('Load RKNN model failed')
    exit(ret)
print('done')
```
### Load the image Object
Load the input image specified with the path we set
```python copy
img = Image.open(IMAGE_PATH)
img = img.convert("L")
img = np.expand_dims(img, 0)
```

### Initialize RKNNLite
Start up the NPU runtime libraries
```python copy
print('--> Init runtime environment')
ret = rknn_lite.init_runtime()
if ret != 0:
    print('Init runtime environment failed!')
    exit(ret)
print('done')
```

### Add extra outer dimension
RKNN supports batch processing, so we have to encapsulate the image object within another dimension
```python copy
img = np.array([img])
```

### Invoke the inference
Invoke the inference call and process all the input samples
```python copy
st = time.time()
output = rknn_lite.inference(inputs=[img])
en = time.time()
```

### Print the inferenced output and some time statistics
The time statistic is simply a start stop time difference, while the inference prediction 
is the index of the highest prediction confidence.
```python copy
print("Inference in: ", (en - st) * 1000, "ms" )
print("predicts: ", np.argmax(output))
```
</Steps>

Remember the model, and image files should be in the same path as this script.

# Example run

here is an example running on the [Khadas Edge2](https://www.khadas.com/edge2),

```shell
--> Load RKNN model
done
--> Init runtime environment
I RKNN: [08:25:37.584] RKNN Runtime Information: librknnrt version: 1.5.2 (c6b7b351a@2023-08-23T15:28:22)
I RKNN: [08:25:37.584] RKNN Driver Information: version: 0.7.2
W RKNN: [08:25:37.584] Current driver version: 0.7.2, recommend to upgrade the driver to the new version: >= 0.8.8
I RKNN: [08:25:37.584] RKNN Model Information: version: 6, toolkit version: 1.5.2+b642f30c(compiler version: 1.5.2 (c6b7b351a@2023-08-23T07:39:01)), target: RKNPU v2, target platform: rk3588, framework name: TFLite, framework layout: NHWC, model inference type: static_shape
done
Inference in:  0.6785392761230469 ms

```

# Notes:
To do any optimization on the model with the [conversion step](/guides/rknn/tflite_conversion.mdx), you'll need to specify a sample input in the form of
an sample image `.png`, or `.jpg` or `.npy` file.
