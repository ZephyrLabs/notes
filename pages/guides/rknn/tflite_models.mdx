# Introduction
RKNN2 is Rockchip's software suite to utilize the NPU on their new device platforms like the RK3588 and RK3566.

The NPU doesn't directly run models as is, you need to convert them into the custom `.rknn` format.

To do so, there is the RKNN-Toolkit2 which lets you analyze, quantize, convert and see how the model would run on the NPU layer wise.

# Prequisites

This guide is a look into how you can convert and run some basic TFLite models, it targets the following platforms
* RK3566/RK3568 (3.0 TOPs NPU)
* RK3588/RK3588S (6.0 TOPs NPU)
